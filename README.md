# Kotlin - Another Baldi's Basics Classic Decompile
Kotlin is a new Baldi's Basics decompile and a framework designed to make modding easier. It is currently a work-in-progress project.

## Why Kotlin?
Kotlin features a lot of quality-of-life changes and new features like:
- Optimization
- Text translation
- Subtitles
- Improved item system
- [Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MKEgnFOoAUbwTa6okis_CD0ZwFglf9zcTP7tvofs3Z0/edit#heading=h.dn4zq8vy014w) 
> Please note that documentation may look horrible by design

Kotlin was also made because BASIC, another decompile of Baldi's Basics lacked documentation and often, the code was unstable due to bugs.

## Progress Report
Kotlin is currently **In Development**. It is **40%** finished so far.

### What now?
You could use the current state of the decompile for your mods but keep in mind that you will have to handle merge conflicts in the future. If you have any questions or issues please open an issue on this repo.
